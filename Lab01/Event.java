/**
 * The Event class is an abstract class that encapsulates a
 * discrete event to be simulated. An event encapsulates the
 * time the event occurs. A subclass of event _must_ override
 * the simulate() method to implement the logic of the
 * simulation when this event is simulated. The simulate method
 * returns an array of events, which the simulator will then
 * add to the event queue. Note that an event also implements
 * the Comparable interface so that a PriorityQueue can
 * arrange the events in the order of event time.
