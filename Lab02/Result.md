(-0.5) Missing Shop class (violation of Encapsulation; from Lab 1)
(-0.5) Passing of Queue instance across Events (violation of Tell, Don\'t Ask)

The Shop should be responsible for initialising and keeping track of all Counters in the shop. It should also initialise and hide a Queue instance, only exposing the methods that are required via methods in the Shop class. (i.e. Events should not interact with a Queue instance directly)

Overall logic of code is sound, good job!
Do remember to fix the things mentioned above before your next lab submission.
